# Initial Architecture Decisions

This file records the architectural decisions that should remain stable while the first implementation is developed.

## AD-001 - Avalonia is a presentation layer only

The core project is UI-framework independent. Avalonia objects must not be referenced by the domain model.

## AD-002 - Platform-neutral project model

A `.kbdproj` describes physical keys, logical mappings and modifier outputs without serializing Windows `KBDTABLES` or other native structures.

## AD-003 - JSON project persistence

Projects use versioned JSON with a dedicated `.kbdproj` extension. `schemaVersion` is mandatory from version 1.

## AD-004 - Physical geometry uses templates

Standard keyboard geometry is stored in reusable templates such as ISO-105 and ANSI-104. Projects reference a template rather than duplicating geometry.

## AD-005 - Native Windows source is generated directly

KeyboardStudio is intended to generate native Windows keyboard layout source rather than using MSKLC as a required build dependency.

## AD-006 - Source generation and compilation are separate

`WindowsCSourceGenerator` can be tested without MSVC/WDK. `INativeCompiler` owns actual native process execution.

## AD-007 - Initial modifier scope is intentionally limited

The first release supports `Default`, `Shift`, `AltGr`, and `ShiftAltGr`. More advanced modifier states, dead keys and ligatures are deferred.

## AD-008 - All editing mutations pass through KeyboardEditor

ViewModels orchestrate UI state but do not directly mutate arbitrary nested project state. This leaves room for validation, dirty tracking and undo/redo.

## AD-009 - General and Windows metadata are separate

`ProjectMetadata` contains only cross-platform information: display name, description, user-managed project version, and language/locale. Windows layout identity is represented by `WindowsLayoutMetadata` in `KeyboardStudio.Windows` and must not be added to `KeyboardStudio.Core`.

The durable `.kbdproj` representation will place Windows metadata in a target-specific persistence section when P1.3 introduces DTO mapping. Author metadata is deferred until a generated resource or another concrete feature needs it.
